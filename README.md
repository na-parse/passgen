# passgen webapp

Simple password generation webapp while I try to learn a bit more about
javascript, modern TypeScript, next.js, and React development.

## Why?

I built a little python script to make random passwords for myself because 
the built in password generators in all the various password managers I use
either don't produce passwords big/secure enough for my preference, or they
aren't _easily_ configurable enough.
