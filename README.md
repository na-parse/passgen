# passgen

Simple password generate webapp:

https://passgen.unit03.net

## What?

Web-app version of a python script I wrote a while back to generate my
passwords since I didn't like most of the built in generators in the
password managers I use.

## Why?

### Security

I'm picky about which symbols I want to use for cross site and embedding
purposes.  Length is also the most important part of password 
generation, and most other generators seem to think 16 is long enough.

### Learning

I'm still living in the good old Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP days of webdev
and I really need to get up to speed on modern framework driven design.

## TODO

Configurable overrides to the rule values on the page itself.
